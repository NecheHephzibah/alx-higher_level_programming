This repository contains tasks on TDD, Test Driven Development. Doctest is an inbuilt test framework that comes bundled with Python by default. The doctest module searches for code fragments that resemble interactive Python sessions and runs those sessions to confirm they operate as shown.

Unittest test case runners allow more options when running tests, like reporting test statistics such as tests that passed and failed.
